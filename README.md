####Team Members Information - Aditya Raj (22BDS002), Akash Nayak (22BDS003)

#### IMPORTANT: Please setup Hadoop, Spark and GraphX using documentation from Apache <br>
#### Download the src folder and run everything on spark-shell.sh after single-client/multi-node setup configuration depending on the algorithm complexity<br>

## GraphX Programs

The source code for all the programs are located in src/.

This repository consists of eight programs all written in scala. We initially wrote these scala programs as objects but converted it to line-by-line scala code for easy execution in the spark-shell. For converting the scala programs into jar files and for execution on Hadoop(MapReduce), you must use sbt for conversion and then spark-submit.

Algorithms Utilised - <br>

2. Connected Components
3. Triangle Counting
4. Shortest Paths
